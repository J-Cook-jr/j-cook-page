<div class="item a"><h2>Who Is Jeff Cook</h2> <p>Jeff Cook is a 28 year old Atlanta native and soon to be first generation web developer. He enjoys spending his free time outdoors in nature and he is intrigued by the untouched parts of the earth. His sparked interest in tech came from witnessing the way we depend upon it in our everyday lives. Being graced with a pioneering spirit, Jeff could not ignore his desire to become one of the greatest creators in the technology industry. He discovered his love for front end web development while working on his pre-work project for the March 2020 Digital Crafts immersive program in Atlanta, Ga. Front end web development has allowed him to tap in to his problem solving abilities in a creative way. As a person who enjoys hobbies such as writing poetry, music producing, painting and visual arts, learning to create web pages using HTML,CSS and Javascript was a smooth transition into the programming world for Jeff. He is a firm believer in people being able to do what they love and make a living while doing it. It will come as no surprise when Jeff enters the workforce as a highly motivated front end web developer after his successful completion of the full-stack web development course at Digital-crafts.</p></div>
<div class="item b"><h2>The Westside</h2><p>A major part of what keeps Jeff focused on achieving greatness is the place he comes from, Atlanta’s westside neighborhood Grove Park. Grove Park is a historical neighborhood in Atlanta that was once home to many working class families. During the late 80’s and early 90’s it slowly started transforming into what is now considered one of the worst parts of Atlanta to reside in. The westside has become notorious for crimes such as illegal drug activity and gun violence. Jeff spent much of his childhood and teenage years in this environment, by the grace of God and with the guidance of his praying family he made it out of what some would consider an active war zone. Even though he was surrounded by poverty, his head was always on doing better for himself and his family. Jeff learned how to save money and financially provide for himself at the age of 15 when he got his first job working at Mc Donalds as a fry cook. He used his earnings to alleviate some of the financial strains of his single mother, whom was responsible for raising him and his younger brother. Even tho his early life was challenging, Jeff appreciates the struggle he and his family endured. He believes struggle promotes growth, it’s an integral part of what drives him everyday to be the best version of himself. </p></div>
